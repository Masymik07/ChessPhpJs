      you paste your private key to your
      spreadsheet ( you can find it in json
      file from google cloud ),

    - secound one is range this is name of 
      your spreadsheet followed by exclamation 
      mark and then fields you want to acces,
      if you want to acces all fields the range 
      woud be "NameOfYourShield!A:Z" otherwise
